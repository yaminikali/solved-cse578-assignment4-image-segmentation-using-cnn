<strong>Assignment-4 </strong>

<strong>Instructions:</strong>

<ul>

 <li>The assignment aims to familiarize you with the basic training of CNNs and different loss function.</li>

 <li><strong>Make sure that the assignment that you submit is your own work. Any breach of this rule could result in serious actions including a W grade in the course.</strong></li>

 <li>We recommend you to start your work early and do not wait till the deadline.</li>

 <li>Make sure your files can be opened. Corrupted files will not be entertained.</li>

 <li><strong>You can use Tensorflow or PyTorch for this. However, you are expected to implement it yourselves and not use an existing implementation.</strong></li>

 <li>The dataset is kept small to facilitate training on CPU. Students would not require GPU for this assignment.</li>

 <li>Download the train/validation dataset from <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar">this link.</a></li>

</ul>

<strong>Tasks:</strong>

<h1>Object Detection</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Train a convolutional neural network with 3-4 layer depth for identifying different objects in the image.</li>

 <li>Predict the object category and the bounding box of the object.</li>

 <li>Show results on 3 different loss functions or ideas discussed in the class. You can use a combination of classification and localization loss with different weights.</li>

 <li>Experiment with different combinations of convolution, batch norm, pooling and activation layers. Try varying learning rates and weight decay hyperparameters as well.</li>

 <li>Report your results on the test data of the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge. The test dataset can be downloaded from <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar">this link.</a></li>

 <li>Use the evaluation metrics and scripts given</li>

</ol>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Write modular code, with comments clearly outlining the function of each module.</li>

 <li>The code must be robust and scalable i.e, it should work for a larger dataset with similar input structure.</li>

 <li>Add the code to the report as well and explain it wherever necessary.</li>

 <li>Make sure you provide the code separately also and not just in the report.</li>

 <li>Try to explain the different loss functions in the report.</li>

 <li>Please ensure that the report contains your roll number. Zip the code and report for submission. The zip file should be named RollNumber Assignment4.zip .</li>

</ul>
